# SELF-LEARNING-ADAPTIVE-CYBERSECURITY-SYSTEM.
AI-driven cybersecurity system that automates real-time threat detection and network log analysis, reducing SOC workload and boosting security through vulnerability data correlation.
# Project Overview

** Real-Time Threat Detection **  
  The system continuously monitors network traffic, using machine learning algorithms to detect suspicious activities    and potential vulnerabilities. It processes raw data, extracts key features, and applies advanced anomaly detection    techniques to flag threats.

** AI-Driven Analysis **  
  A pre-trained AI model, fine-tuned with cybersecurity datasets from sources like the CVE database and Kaggle,          serves  as the core engine. This model classifies threats, assigns severity levels, and assists in the decision-making process for threat escalation.

** User Education and Sensitization **  
  Recognizing that cybersecurity is not just about technology but also about people, the project integrates an           interactive training module. A chatbot provides non-security staff with tailored cybersecurity awareness and best      practices, ensuring that every member of an organization is equipped to recognize and mitigate potential threats.

** Modular and Scalable Architecture **  
  Designed with flexibility in mind, the system is built using modular components that can be independently develped,    tested, and scaled. This architecture not only facilitates integration with existing infrastructure but also allows    for continuous updates as new threats emerge.
